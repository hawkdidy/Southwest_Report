# Southwest_Report
A jupyter notebook doing an an A-Z anaylsis of flight data from 1987-2008. There are two notebooks in this repo. The first one is Exploring_Domestic_Flights which is just my exploritory notebook. It shows more of my thought process on the analysis. The second one, SouthWest_Airline_Review is my final analysis, the full story.
